# What have changed

What have changed is a tool that looks in two directory and show you the files that have changed. It displays changes with an output Ã -la Subversion :

	M /media/all/styles.css
	D /media/images/404.gif
	A /js/ext-4.0.0.js

## Could you not use an existing tool

I wanted to use a standalone tool that compare two different directory. I tried 
quickly different tools but nothing could give me a simple input. Maybe I didn't 
search thoroughly as I should, but developping the tool was really easy.

## Current state

It's currently in heavy development. So if you are able to make it work, do it with precaution because it may crash easily.
